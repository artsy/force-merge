## Create a Topic Branch

Make sure your fork is up-to-date and create a topic branch for your feature or bug fix.

```sh
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```

## Write Tests

Write tests for all new features and fixes. Run tests with `npm test`.

We definitely appreciate pull requests that highlight or reproduce a problem, even without a fix.

## Write Code

Implement your feature or bug fix.

## Commit Changes

Make sure git knows your name and email address:

```sh
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "contributor@example.com"
```

## Push

```sh
git push origin my-feature-branch
```

## Make a Pull Request

Go to https://github.com/contributor/force and select your feature branch.
Click the 'Pull Request' button and fill out the form. Pull requests are usually reviewed within a few days.

## Rebase

If you've been working on a change for a while, rebase with upstream/master.

```
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master
git push origin my-feature-branch -f
```

## Check on Your Pull Request

Go back to your pull request after a few minutes and see whether it passed muster with Semaphore. Everything should look green, otherwise fix issues and amend your commit as described above.

## Be Patient

It's likely that your change will not be merged and that the nitpicky maintainers will ask you to do more, or fix seemingly benign problems. Hang on there!

## Thank You

Please do know that we really appreciate and value your time and work. We love you, really. <3
